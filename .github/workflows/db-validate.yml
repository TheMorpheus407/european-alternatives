# DB MIGRATION VALIDATION WORKFLOW
#
# Runs on PRs that modify data files, migration scripts, or API code.
# Validates that:
#   1. TypeScript type checking passes
#   2. Linting passes
#   3. The app builds correctly
#   4. The TS data export to JSON works
#   5. Parity tests pass (catalog.json vs TS source of truth)
#   6. TS export round-trip: re-exporting produces identical catalog.json (Phase 3)
#   7. A baseline snapshot is captured and uploaded as an artifact
#
# This workflow is part of Phase 2/3 of the DB migration plan.
# See DB_MIGRATION_PLAN.md for context.

          # Phase 3 validation: verify that re-exporting TS data produces
          # an identical catalog.json. This ensures the export pipeline is

          # through the export process.

          # This step does NOT require the DB — it validates the TS-to-JSON
          # export is stable. When the DB is the source of truth, this proves
          # that exported TS files produce identical payloads to what the DB
          # would generate.
