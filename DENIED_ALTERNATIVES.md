# Denied Alternatives

Alternatives that were evaluated and rejected from the catalogue, with reasoning and sources.

All denied alternatives are stored in the database and served via the API:

```
https://european-alternatives.cloud/api/catalog/entries.php?status=denied
```

Each denied entry includes the full denial reasoning, failed gateway criteria, claimed vs. actual origin, and sourced citations.
